# HospitalManagement-App
Android application created to establish a connection between doctors and patients during their post medication. 

Recent days due to the unprecedented pandemic, it is getting more diffic1ult to find a doctor and fix appointment with the patient who were unable to go to hospital to visit doctor. With help of this app, patients can easily post their issues with details along with their requested appointment time. Doctor can view those issues and fix their appointment time from the app. Once their appointments were confirmed, app will automatically set up an alarm to both patient and doctor who accepted their appointment. By this app both the patient and doctor doesnâ€™t have to be physically present at the same place, both of them can conveniently attend call at their different places. 
This app is created using android studio and code is written using java. We used Firebase Realtime Database to store the data of the patient, doctor and appointment from which the app communicates.  We included Material design dependence to enhance the appearance of the app. To establish a secured authentication, we used firebase authentication.
